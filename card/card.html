			Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20 hours per day.
			Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk
			with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity
			follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place.
		  They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating
